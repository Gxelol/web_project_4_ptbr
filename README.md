**Introduction**

  This is a fully responsive HTML, CSS and JavaScript landing page. This project simulates a profile with your posts like a social media.
  It was used BEM methodology for organization and clean codes.

  Update: Now the landing page has forms validation, delete button and like button. I used Javascript to perform all the validation, try adding something without the url or just type a letter to see how it works.

  Update 0.2: Change to classes, Card and FormValidator, for more maintainability, reusability and scalability.
